 restore_merv_desc:0 "Achamenid, Greeks, Arabs, Turks; all enjoyed the prosperity and the produce of the once great city of Merv. Multitudes of markets, overflowing with great goods and bringing in even greater taxes and rewards to the merchants who transversed the silk roads to bring them to this oasis of tranquillity. 400 Artisans was all that was left when it finally was destroyed by the bloodline of the Great Khan. 400 Artisans was all that was left of what should be one of the greatest cities of our realms. If we are ever to rise to such a global importance as those who held these lands before, we must restore the great trading city of Merv so that it one day will have 400,000 Artisans!"
