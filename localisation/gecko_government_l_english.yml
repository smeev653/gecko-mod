 silk_road_empire_desc:0 "With the destruction of the Mongol Empire, the unity of the silk road ended. The Yams disappeared, the postal system was destroyed, and banditry became rife. If we are ever to restore the Silk Road, the foundation of our entire state must be geared towards this. Our people must be one in aim, we will be like the Arab traders, spreading our faith and commerce wherever we can."
